The "Paying Guest (PG) Recommendation System" is developed through a series of methodical steps to ensure accurate and user-centric recommendations. The process involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather detailed information from various sources, including comprehensive data on paying guest accommodations near educational institutions.

Data Processing: Utilize the Pandas library to handle and preprocess the collected data. This includes data cleaning, transformation, and organization to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and uncover insights. This step involves analyzing patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.

User Input Handling: Allow users to input the name of their college. The system uses this input to identify and filter the relevant data based on the specified location.

Visualization: Plot the recommended PG accommodations on a geographical map to provide a visual representation of their proximity to the userâ€™s college. Additionally, display a list of these PG accommodations for easy reference.

By following these steps, the system efficiently processes and visualizes data to deliver accurate and actionable recommendations for users seeking nearby paying guest accommodations.
